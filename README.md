Project Overview and Objectives
Objective: To develop a simplified e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete a simulated checkout process. The core focus is on implementing an AI-driven recommendation engine to suggest products based on user behavior, enhancing the shopping experience. A basic chatbot for customer support is an optional but valuable addition.

Key Components:
* E-commerce Core: Product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, order management.
* Data Management: Database to store product information, user profiles, order history, and user-product interactions.
* Recommendation Engine: An AI model that analyzes user behavior (e.g., views, purchases) to generate personalized product recommendations.
* Web Interface: A responsive frontend for users to interact with the platform.
* Simulated Payment Gateway: A mock payment process for checkout.
* Basic Chatbot (Optional): A simple conversational agent for common queries.
